Building IMAGE                               			02 Apr 2003 
==============

Image is a simple, fast image viewer that works with OS/2's MMPM/2 and 
includes some editing features.  It is intended for use with File Manager/2 
(FM/2).  Image is free software from Mark Kimes.


Tools
=====

The following tools have been used to build binary distributions:

  IBM VisualAge C++ V3 with FP8
  IBM Developers Toolkit v4.5

Older versions of the Toolkit may work.  There are no known special setup requirements.


Building
========

Unzip the source code distribution to a work directory.

Build the release version with:

  NMAKE

Build the debug version with:

  NMAKE DEBUG=1

The final build output is:

  IMAGE.EXE
