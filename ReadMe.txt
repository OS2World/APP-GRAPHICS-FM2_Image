IMAGE.EXE version 0.02                         			27 Oct 2001
======================

Image is a simple, fast image viewer that works with OS/2's MMPM/2 and 
includes some editing features.  It is intended for use with File Manager/2 
(FM/2).  Image is free software from Mark Kimes.


Installation
============

To install IMAGE, place:

 IMAGE.EXE

in the directory of your choice.  If you intend to run IMAGE from the command 
line, this directory should be in the PATH.  You can create a program object 
to start IMAGE if you wish.


Using Image
===========

Just enter 'IMAGE' from an OS/2 command prompt or start it from a program object.

The program will open with a File Open dialog.  Pick the image you want to display.

If an image name is supplied on the command line the dialog box will be 
bypassed and the image will be displayed immediately.

To copy an image file to the clipboard, use:

  IMAGE /C <imagefile>


Uninstalling
============

To remove IMAGE, delete

 IMAGE.EXE

IMAGE does not store any settings.


Known problems/shortcomings
=========================== 

These problems have been reported but have not been duplicated.

 - Chris Wohlgemuth's Multimedia Extensions break display of "Image     
   Information"

 - Titlebar sometimes changes to "ress"

IMAGE was originally written by:

  <hectorplasmic@worldnet.att.net>

He has kindly allowed me to take over maintenance and support of IMAGE and 
to release the program under the GNU GPL license.  I'm sure he would 
appreciate a Thank You note for his generosity.
